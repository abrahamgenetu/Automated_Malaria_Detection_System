Automated Web-Based Malaria Detection System

This project is an automated web-based malaria detection system that uses machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning techniques. The system is designed to help diagnose malaria more accurately and efficiently, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities.

The project involves training three different models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Transfer Learning with Inception, VGG19, and Xception. A comparative analysis of these models is performed to evaluate their performance and accuracy in malaria detection.

The dataset used in this project is the Malaria Cell Images Dataset, which contains 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells. The dataset is preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets.

The demo of the project can be accessed at [https://malar-ai.netlify.app/. ↗](https://malar-ai.netlify.app/.) Users can upload an image of a blood smear slide, and the system will classify the image as parasitized or uninfected using the trained models. The performance of the models is displayed, and the user can compare the results of each model.

Instructions for Running the Project Locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the web application with `python app.py`.
4. Access the application at [http://localhost:5000/ ↗](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser.
